## Welcome to my GitHub Page

You can use my github page to browse for content related to technology. We can talk about Robotics, Programming, Computer security, Cloud, Web apps, Mobile apps, Networks, Lumped Circuit Abstraction, Solar Photo voltiacs,And let's not forget physics.

Github is a really cool place to learn and commit your codes. You can share your codes here , so that people who are in need of it can directly download or clone it.

I am going to be active on Github, and I want you to write to me @ ankit.ethics@gmail.com, if you need any help or if you have any doubt, you can also call me @ +91- 7042416393
We may think that we know so much about everything, but in real, we don't know anything. We should try to be a visionary and look at things with different views, and that's how Imagination works.
A great man once said, Imagination is more important than knowledge. The man was Sir Albert Einstien
We should also learn to appreciate others. If we can't appreciate others for their good, then we should do the same to ourselves. Be rational !
